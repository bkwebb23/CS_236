# CS_236

This repo contains all the code I wrote for CS 236 (Discrete Structure) at BYU. Each of the 5 main projects built on top of the previous to create a full implementation of a Datalog interpreter and relational database.

In Project 1, I wrote the Lexer.

In Project 2, I wrote the Parser.

In Projects 3, 4, and 5, I wrote the actual execution engine.

Class learning objectives: 
 - Understand and be conversant with basic discrete mathematical structures (finite state machines, regular expressions, grammars, propositional calculus, proof techniques, predicate calculus, sets, relations, functions, graphs).
 - Write complex programs by using mathematical concepts as the basis for solving programming problems (finite state machines for lexical analysis; grammars for parsing; propositional and predicate calculus for logic programming; sets and algebras for relational databases; algebras, graphs, and topological sorting for optimizing datalog query processing).
 - Incrementally build sophisticated programs by a systematic design process based on discrete mathematics.
 - Design a solution for a programming problem and justify the design as one that is maintainable and extendable by other programmers who understand and are conversant with discrete mathematical structures.
